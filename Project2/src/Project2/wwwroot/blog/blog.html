                    <p>When I first started working in Vim I was intimidated. However with some tools I&#39;m going to talk about I hopefully can help you get up to speed fairly quickly.</p>

                    <h3><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html">vimtutor</a></h3>

                    <p>Hopefully already installed on your distro, this handy tutorial is interactive and encourages you to edit from within the tutorial. You can access this by typing in &#39;vimtutor&#39; (no quotes) and pressing enter. Pretty cool, and my recommended first step for beginners</p>

                    <h3><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a></h3>

                    <p>Besides an excellent resource for learning the basics of the linux command line, it also includes a gentle introduction to vi/vim. William Shotts is great at presenting a broad-strokes tour of linux, and if you like his free book, feel free to buy the paper version.</p>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">My Favorite Textbooks from College</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-meta">January 15, 2016 by <a href="/index.html">Afton</a></p>
                    <p>Kind of weird, but I&#39;d thought I&#39;d list my favorite books and/or textbooks from attending UCO.</p>

                    <h3><a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/">Programming: Principles and Practices using C++</a></h3>

                    <p>For anyone that asserts C++ is not for beginners I present to you the creator of C++ and is book explicitly for beginners. If you think this is the book that&#39;s normally mentioned by him, The C++ Programming Language, you can be forgiven. But also realize this book is SO much easier, and the questions in the book really encourage you to think about different scenarios and start to think logically like a programmer.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">The C Programming Language</a></h3>

                    <p>This book is an elegant intro to C. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it to an absolute beginner, but if you watched some youtube tutorials before digging into this surprisingly concise book, it would really benefit you. It&#39;s constantly referenced as a great example of technical writing and is used as the standard that technical tutorial style books try to emulate.</p>

                    <h3><a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Systems: A Programmer&#39;s Perspective</a></h3>

                    <p>Really good book, and in my opinion would have served me better than my hardware based classes, as its focused on techniques that are important and useful to be a great programmer, rather than a systems engineer. Optimization, compiler techniques and a dab of assembly: it really hits the sweet spot between computer architecture and software engineering.</p>

                    <h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Design-Pattern-Essentials-Edition/dp/0956575846">Java Design Pattern Essentials</a></h3>

                    <p>After trying my brain with the GOF book on design patterns, I really wanted and hoped that there was a more dumbed down resource for explaining design patterns that was concise and read less like a white-paper. That and the fact that I was using Java, which I&#39;ve heard was designed the intention of strictly conforming to GOF&#39;s ideas about design patterns. This book is so small, yet so effective in getting the basic idea of the pattern across. It does this with effective code naming and family, species, or real-life-type relationships rather than long explanations(GOF) or entertaining anecdotes (Head First Design Patterns).</p>
